Let's see how easy is to use GQ to filter a JSON file.

Over this JSON:

```json
{
  "user": "John",
  "bill": {
    "purchaser": "One S.A",
    "seller": "Two S.A",
    "products": [
      {
        "name": "Product 1",
        "quantity": 3,
        "price": { "value": 1.0, "currency": "EUR" },
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
      },
      {
        "name": "Product 2",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": { "value": 2.0, "currency": "USD" },
        "tags": ["tag3"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- We can use this simple graphql-like query to get only the name and price of each product:

```graphql
{
  bill {
    products {
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
```
